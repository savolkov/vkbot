# VKBot
A very simple VK API bot used to run `!command` in chat and anything else.

You can send pull-requests with your suggested fixes and plugins for bot.

Bot is configured to run in Heroku Dyno as a worker.

## Quick start
Rename `config-sample.py` to `config.py`, fill in all nesessary fields. Run `python bot.py`.
